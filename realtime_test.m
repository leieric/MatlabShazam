% Fall 2017 ECE 2200, Shazam Competition - Realtime test
% Instruction:
% The program will first ask you to write your NetIDs. Please enter in form
% of [netID1]_[netID2].
% Then the program will automatically run your Shazam program on the following 3 clips (but not restricted to this order):
% 1. Randomly chosen song without noise
% 2. Randomly chosen song added high-frequency Gaussian noise(3000Hz
% to 22050Hz) with SNR=0dB
% 3. Randomly chosen song added high-frequency Gaussian noise(3000Hz
% to 22050Hz) with random SNR between -15dB to 5dB. 

% As the program compltes, it will save the following parameters:
% 1. credit: Realtime test credit (max: 0.3, min: 0.0)
% 2. correct: names of a song that identified correctly
% 3. incorrect: names of a song that identified incorrectly
% 4. noDecision: names of a song that identified as no-decision
% 5. time: the time in second that the Shazam program took for running each test clip
% clips.
% You can load [netID1]_[netID2]_realtime_test.mat to check your
% performance.
